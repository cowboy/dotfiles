Curl a remote file into an editor.

echo "Usage: $(basename "$0") [curloptions...] url"

Curl a remote file into the editor of your choice. The filename will be based
on the URL's filename. If a file extension can't be determined from the URL,
index.html will be used.

The editor will be auto-magically determined by stripping any leading "curl"
off this script's filename. For example, call this script "curlmate" and "mate"
will be run.
