Usage: eachdir [dirs --] commands

Run one or more commands in one or more dirs.

By default, all subdirs of the current dir will be iterated over, but if --
is specified as an arg, the dirs list will be made up of all args specified
before it. All remaining args are the command(s) to be executed for each dir.

Multiple commands must be specified as a single string argument.

In bash, aliasing like this allows you to specify aliases/functions:
  alias eachdir=". eachdir"

Both of these print the working directory of every subdir of the current dir:
  eachdir pwd
  eachdir * -- pwd

Perform a "git pull" inside all subdirs starting with repo-:
  eachdir repo-* -- git pull

Perform a few git-related commands inside all subdirs starting with repo-:
  eachdir repo-* -- 'git fetch && git merge'
