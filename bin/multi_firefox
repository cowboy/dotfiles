Multi-Firefox Fixer
http://benalman.com/

Usage: $(basename "$0")

Run this shell script to "fix" all /Applications/Firefox*.app to always use an
app-named profile. For example, if an application is named "Firefox Beta.app"
then the "Firefox Beta" profile will always be loaded when that application is
run. This allows multiple versions of Firefox to be open simultaneously.

Note that upon first run of a "fixed" Firefox, an app-named profile will need
to be created. This can be done in the dialog that Firefox displays, just be
sure to name it correctly!
