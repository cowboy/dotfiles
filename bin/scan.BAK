Port-scan one machine or everything on your subnet(s).
http://benalman.com/

Usage: #{File.basename $0} [--full] [host_or_ip_or_wildcard ...]

Scans your subnet(s) using nmap, displaying results in a pretty format. If *
appears at the end of the line, that IP is currently bound to this machine.

Specify --full for a full subnet port scan (this can take a while), or specify
one or more hosts, IPs or wildcards on which to perform a full port scan. The
--full option is implicit when any hosts, IPs or wildcards are specified.

Maybe it'll help you find that server you lost. It didn't help me--but that's
only because the machine I was looking for wasn't connected. Whoops.
