# Configurations that you can override; if you leave these commented out,
# Byobu will try to auto-detect them.

# This should be auto-detected for most distro, but setting it here will save
# some call to lsb_release and the like.
#DISTRO=Ubuntu

# Default: depends on the distro (which is either auto-detected, either set
# via $DISTRO)
#LOGO="\o/"

# Abbreviate the release to N characters
# By default, this is disabled.  But if you set RELEASE_ABBREVIATED=1
# and your lsb_release is "precise", only "p" will be displayed
#RELEASE_ABBREVIATED=1

# Default: /
#MONITORED_DISK=/

# Default: bits

# You can add an additional source of temperature here

# The users notification normally counts ssh sessions; set this configuration to '1'
